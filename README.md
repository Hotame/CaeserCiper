The Core Idea Behind This Program Is That You Press 'encode' To Encrypt Any Text By Entering The Shift Amount, And Then You Have An Encrypted Text.
When You Want To Check, Just Press 'decode' And Enter The Encrypted Text You Got With The "Correct" Shift Amount, And Then You Have The Original Text.
Also, If You'd Like To "Repeat" The Process Again, Just Press 'yes' And The Program Will Automatically Restart.

Enjoy~
